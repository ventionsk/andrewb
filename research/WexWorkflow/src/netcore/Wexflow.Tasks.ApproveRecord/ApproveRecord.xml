  <!--
    ApproveRecord is a sequential task that assigns a record to a user and launches the approval process on that record.
    
    To use this task the workflow must be an approval workflow. This can be done whether from the designer 
    page in the backend or by editing the XML or JSON definitions of the workflow.
    
    If the workflow is rejected the OnRejected workflow event is raised and the tasks after Approval
    task are not executed.
    
    The rejection of workflows can be done by clicking on reject button whether from Approval page in the backend
    or from Wexflow Manager.
